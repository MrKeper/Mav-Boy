project 4
Around 6 hours spent on project
Logical Mistakes:

1: Not enough grid spaces allocated for grid layout, needed to have size of array list +1 more for total revenue but forgot to add +1

2: created button and action listener but did not addActionListener so it did nothing... so I added the listener

3: used close() to get rid of window opened by action button and it ended program. So i used dispose()
